So, I'll be honest... I haven't finished writing this post. It'll be published soon! For now, you can enjoy this picture of Nashville instead:

There are an indimiating number of excellent front-end tools -- this is a both blessing and a curse.

Today, we've got like 1000 reasonable approaches for building a blog. This can be really daunting. Do I need a a Javascript framework, or is that too heavy-handed? How will I write and store my content? Where will I host it? How do I make it look good?

I've landed on a stack that offers an exceptional developer experience, crazy fast load times, and the flexibility to create rich and interactive client-side experiences.

**The Stack:** The trifecta of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/).

This blog post will break down the "why" of each of these technolgoies.

## Why Next.js?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) calls itself _The React Framework for Production_, and for good reason.

Taking a step back -- the [React](https://reactjs.org/) ecosystem is flourising right now. The library has matured tremdously in the (8!) years since it was intially released, as has the community surrounding it.

There are so many mature, battle-tested React-based tools on offer. I want to leverage that ecosystem. There is no shortage of component-based JS frameworks, but React remains the most established.

One could argue that React (or any JS framework, for that matter) is too heavy handed for a simple blog. That perhaps it's overkill. I would argue that the tools and optimizations are so good now, that there's little reason not to lean on a framework.

Let's talk ahout that.

### What's special about Next.js?

Next.js provides a suite of features & conventions around React that greatly simplify the process of creating a web application. Some standouts include:

- Static Generation AND Server Side Rendering
- File-based routing (make a JS file, and you've got a page)
- Zero configuration (no custom Webpack or Babel configs ðŸ˜±!)
- Built-in client-side routing and image optimization
- Dead simple serverless API creation
- ...[and more](https://nextjs.org/#features)!

Our of the box, React doesn't have an opinion on how your application is structured. Next.js provides **sensible defaults** that get you out of the buissness of making decisions about boilerplate. I've written a lot of custom Webpack configs, and it's rarely how I'd like to be spending my time.

Next's biggest competitive advantage, in my view, is the way that it approaches server-side rendering. To being with, every page is pre-rendered. This means that the markup for each page is generated _before_ it gets to the user's browser. No waiting for React to load and construct the DOM from scratch.

Crucially, it allows for both static generation AND server side-rendering on a per-page basis. This is truly the best of both worlds.

For static content (e.g. this blog post), Next.js can staticly generate the page at **build-time**, then immediately cache the result for Jamstack-level performance. For dynamic content (e.g. a user's personal settings page), there are several options for dynamically generating the page at **request time**.

<!-- Use Link component -->

This flexibility makes Next.js appropriate for small static blogs like christiancodes.io _and_ massive dynamic applications like TikTok.

### What about other React Frameworks?

I see two major competitors to Next.js in the React ecosytem: Gatsby and Create React App

All of these frameworks are useful, but Next.js retains an advantage in several areas:

#### Next.js vs Gatsby

Gatsby is a blah.......

It's a great tool, and I've used it for several projects. It has rich ecosystem of plugins, and getting a project spun-up is quick and easy.

Next.js's major advantage over Gatsby is server-side generation at runtime. Gatsby generates everything at build-time, and can't generate dynamic pages on-the-fly. Dynamic data MUST be fetched on the client. There are several scenarios where this is inconvienent.

Moreover, Gatsby is heavily reliant on GraphQL. This isn't necessairly a bad thing, but Next has the benefit of being largely agnostic to how you manage the data layer.

#### Next.js vs Create React App

Create React App is a framework for quickly scaffolding out a new React application. It takes care of boilerplate build configuration and dependencies, and generates a single-page application that can be easily hosted.

Next.js's major advantage over Create React App is in pre-rendering. CRA renders everyting client-side -- the time spent parsing javascript and constructing the DOM can often to lead to a degraded user-experience.

## Why Tailwind?

Tailwind is a CSS framework that uses a component-based approach.

Tradiotnally, DS has tokens in SASS or CSS Var. Tailwind enfources these contstrains out of the box.

### What not just write CSS?

## Why MDX?

MDX is asdasd.

I write markdown all the time. I want to use rich framework features in my markdown.

There are so many ways to use MD in Next.js. I'm using the OOTB one.

### Next.js Integration

mdx-bundler or mdx-remote.

## Putting It All Together

- Hosted on Vercel. Compare Vercel + Netlify. Amplify, UX could use work.
- Extensilble enough to easily add rich application features. Can lead on the incredible React ecosystem.
